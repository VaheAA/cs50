# CS50 Course Solutions and Code Examples

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets and additional code examples from the **CS50 Introduction to Computer Science** course by Harvard University. Each folder corresponds to a specific week of the course and contains the source code for the problems tackled in that week.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders based on the course weeks:

- [x]  **Week 1:** C basics, conditions, loops, and functions.
- [x] **Week 2:** Arrays, strings, and encryption (Caesar, Substitution).
- [x] **Week 3:** Algorithms, searching, sorting (Linear search, Binary search, Bubble sort).
- [ ] **Week 4:** Memory, pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and file I/O.
- [ ] **Week 5:** Data structures (Linked lists, Hash tables).
- [ ] **Week 6+:** Web programming, Python, and additional topics.

Each folder contains:

- **Problem solutions:** My personal solutions to the problem sets.
- **Code examples:** Supplementary code to reinforce the concepts learned during the week.
